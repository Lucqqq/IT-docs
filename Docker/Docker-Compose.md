# Docker-Compose
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container [[Docker]] applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Note that when inputting data for variables, you must follow standard YAML rules. In the case of passwords with special characters this can mean escaping them properly ($ is the escape character) or properly quoting the variable. The best course of action if you do not know how to do this or are unwilling to research, is to stick to alphanumeric characters only.
